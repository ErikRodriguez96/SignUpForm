# SignUpForm

    
  This app features a demo of a user sign up. 
  
## High-Level Overview
  There are fields for a Name, Email, and Password + confirmation. If any of the fields are unfilled, the app will display an error in the appropriate field when the user presses the save button. If the passwords do not match, they will display an error as well. If all fields are filled and passwords match, then when the user presses the save button they get a Toast message welcoming them into the app.
